Fabricating SIN junction
1. Loading the sample
-Unscrew the bottom ("base") of the chamber, where the sample will be loaded.
-Loosen the contacts with a 3 mm hex wrench
-Load the Al boat on the side of the shield labeled "Al" and the Pb(Bi) boat on the other side.
-Tighten the contacts so the boats are secure.
-Check that the boats are aligned so the holes of the shield is above the boat. 
-Place 1 Al pellet and ~2 pellets Pb(Bi) to their respective boats.

2. Placing the junction plate
-Place the "target" in the mask then screw it tight. 
-Insert the "Tommy" into the chamber.
-Set mask to Al setting, 4mm, clamping it down until it no longer shifts
-Pull off top and ensure that the target is aligned vertically and that the shield is covering both
of the slots of the plate.

3. Pumpdown to desired pressure
-Important: Make sure water is on!
-Make sure coarse and fine knob on right side of chamber are closed
-Pump down using turbo pump until ~10^(-3) Torr* look this up

4. Al Evaporation
-Attach the current leads to the Al and ground post.
-Apply current to Aluminum 
-Wait until Aluminum boils & evaporates
-Turn the shield knob clockwise to open slot and expose target to Aluminum vapor
-
-Turn the current source off!!
-Remove current leads onto Pb. 
-Adjust the slide to 46 mm (Pb pads)
-Turn current source on
-Turn the shield knob to expose target to vapor
-Evaporate until the contact pads reach the desired thickness
-Turn the knob back to line up with the black mark
-Turn the current source off

5. Oxidation
-Change mask to Oxidation setting, at 18 mm.
-Close blue knobs of the tank
-Open the gray tank valve
-Verify that green valve is closed
-Open the knob between flask and the chambers to "bleed" / evacuate line
-Open tall bleu knob slowly to desired pressure [20 psi]
-Slowly open short blue knob to bleed line
-Close short blue knob
-Open green valve
-Slowly repressurize chamber using short blue knob until desired pressure []?
-Close blue knob
-Wait 5 minutes for sample to oxidize
-Close the knob between flask and the chambers.
-Close green valve
-Turn on the coarse pump
-Pump back until some pressure [10^(-7) Pa]??? [1+ hour]
-Verify coarse and fine knob are closed

6. Pb evaportaion
-Set mask to 32 mm, the opposite swastika.
-Turn current source back on.
-Turn shield knob counterclockwise to expose target to Pb vapor
-Evaporate Pb until desired thickness is reached on the thickness monitor
-Close shield; align with the black line
-Turn off current source

7. Repressurize
-Turn fine yellow knob on right side of chamber counterclockwise
